		<h5>Music Censorship</h5>
		<p>This project if not already obvious is about censorship in music and media. Especially since the 9/11 a whole list of songs were black listed and taken off the radio. This peice is a simple peice with an appropriate styelized tittle and a cascading body.</p>

		<h5>Jhonny Can't Read</h5>
		<p>This was more of a design peice rather than a regular stuctured article. Adding the red censors on the page to poke fun and literally show censored literature. This peice was to look slightly old style with the red stamped ink you would regularly see in libraries.</p>
